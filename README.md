# OctoPulse

OctoPulse is a modern, GitHub-themed implementation of Conway’s Game of Life. Built with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, it features a crisp UI inspired by GitHub’s design language—including a familiar header, Octicon icons, and adaptive dark mode.

## Purpose

This repository’s purpose is to provide an educational and visually appealing version of Conway’s Game of Life. It serves as both a fun demo of interactive programming and a foundation for experimenting with UI/UX patterns, theming, and TypeScript application structure.

## Features

- **GitHub-inspired UI:** Familiar header, navigation, and button styles.
- **Octicon integration:** Uses [GitHub Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/) for clear, accessible icons.
- **Adaptive Dark Mode:** Follows your system’s color scheme.
- **Responsive Controls:** Play, pause, step, clear, randomize, and adjust speed.
- **Clean TypeScript Source:** Main logic in `Script.ts` for readability and extensibility.

## Current Implementation

- **Frontend:**
  - `Index.html`: Main app markup, links styles and scripts.
  - `Styles.css`: All UI theming, including GitHub-like dark and light modes.
  - `Script.ts`: Conway's Game of Life logic, event handlers, and rendering.
- **No backend required:** All logic runs client-side.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MysticOak17/OctoPulse.git
   ```
2. **Open `Index.html` in your browser.**
   No build step is required; all source files are ready to use.

3. **Play!**
   - Use the Play, Step, Clear, and Random buttons to interact with the simulation.
   - Adjust speed with the slider.
